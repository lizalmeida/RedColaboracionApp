# Mobile application for social collaboration networks

This application arises from the need to have a tool that allows channeling the emerging requirements of people who who are part of a community. There are needs that many times, due to fear, suspicion or believing that there will not be a person to support them, the members of the community do not communicate it, or if they communicate it, they do not find anyone to cover their need or who can provide it, is informed too much late. This experience is new for member users, due to there is not an application that allows members of a community to register, as well as the areas in which they can collaborate with others, and people in need request help and receive it effectively. The group must be small, around 200 people, since the help in several cases is in person, with groceries, medical care, counseling, and the purpose is to increase the sense of belonging to the community.
